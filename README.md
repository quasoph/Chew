Introducing Chew: a C-based compiler translating a small, Python-like language to ARM64 assembly.
To run Chew, create a .ch file and run it in main.c with
``gcc *.c``
followed by
``./a.out``
in your terminal of choice.

Chew currently emits assembly instructions but can be edited to save to file.
Language documentation to come soon :)
